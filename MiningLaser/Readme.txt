  // Mining Laser v1.2                                          //
 // Created by Zion Fox - Based from originals within the game //
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

First and foremost, thanks for downloading my first mod. I hope you have as much pleasures out of using this as I have creating it.

Additionally, I'd like to offer thanks to Ephemerality from IRC, who helped me test and find a flaw with the mod.

  //////////////////
 // Installation //
//////////////////

Installing the mod is as easy as unzipping the file into your ./mods/ folder. The zip contains a file with all the assets within it.

An easier method, if you use 7z, or Winrar, or another GUI based archive program, is to drag and drop the "MiningLaser" folder into the mods folder.

(Re)Start Starbound, and craft a Laser Diode, you should gain a new blueprint for the laser miner.

  ////////////////////////////
 // Crafting and Resources //
////////////////////////////

You gain the crafting recipe after collecting your first Laser Diode, crafted from the Wiring Station.
    If you already have a Laser Diode, drop it on the floor, and pick it up, you should learn the recipe.
    
The laser should now appear in the Robotic Crafting Table near the bottom, or filter to tools, or search.

It requires the following to craft:
    - 15,000 Pixels
    - 40 Uranium Rods
    - 1 Laser Diode
    - 1 Diamond Drill
    
The drill is used for the chassis of the device, the fuel rods help power and create the beam, and the diode is used to focus (and colour) the beam.
    The pixels because you should have around this many by now, and because of the power it has to make it a bit more fair.
    
For this, you gain a mining laser with a durability of 10,000 (Diamond Drill is 3000), that mines a 5x5 (alt is 1x1), at a very fast speed and high power.

The mining laser can also be repaired using the base ores. Copper, Iron, Silver, Gold and Diamond. These can be used like other picks and drills to repair the laser miner.

  /////////////////////////////////
 // Support and Troubleshooting //
/////////////////////////////////

If you are having difficulty finding the recipe for the laser, try using your filter for tools, or searching for it.
Make sure the "New blueprints are available" appears at the bottom when you pick up the Laser Diode.
If it still doesn't appear, make sure you don't have other mods that alter the item file for the Laser Diode.

The graphical and item assets for this are available to all players, all players should see the item being used by you,
and you can transfer the item to them, but they would not be able to use it without this mod. The default laserminer.miningtool file in all installations is not complete, this mod simply completes it.
Due to serverside mods not being transferred to all players yet, installing this on a server will serve no purpose. It will fully work on multiplayer without other players having the mod.

Any other support or questions can be sent to my email: ziontristan@gmail.com
