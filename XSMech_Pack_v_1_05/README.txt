	FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
--------------------------------------

Q: I installed the mod but I don't see the recipes!

A: Make sure that you copied the xs_mech.modpak file and NOT the entire archive into your \Starbound\mods\ folder. If you installed
   correctly, your file structure should read \Starbound\mods\xs_mech.modpak and NOT \Starbound\mods\XSMech_Pack_v_1_05\xs_mech.modpak


Q: Do these mechs work in multiplayer?

A: Short answer: maybe. They should work in multiplayer but under some circumstances they may not work (for instance, if the server
   and/or other players do not have the mod installed)


Q: Other players appear invisible/crash in multiplayer because of this mod!

A: See above note on multiplayer.


Q: I updated from an older version and now my player character is missing!

A: You may not have installed correctly. Don't worry, your character is still there, the game is just looking at your character
   and seeing the old techs, when they are no longer there for whatever reason with the update. If you still have the old version
   of the mod which you updated from, go ahead and reinstall that. Your character should be selectable in-game now. Start up a
   game with your character and remove all mod techs and items from your character via the tech console in your ship. Now quit
   out of Starbound, delete the mod, and then follow normal installation for the update.

	MECHS
--------------------------------------

[S-01] Sigma Mech Tech

Recommended Tier: 4-6
Crafting: 700 pixels, 50 Durasteel Bars at Robotic Crafting Table

The Sigma model represents the culmination of XS's earliest forays into Mech Tech. Originally designed as a construction and exploration
exosuit, Sigma was repurposed for combat with dual miniguns and a cluster grenade rack. Its impressive armament combined with its
efficient, low cost design was the talk of mech enthusiasts everywhere when it was first introduced.

CONTROLS
F: Activate/deactivate tech [10 E/second upkeep]
Primary Fire: Dual miniguns [1.5 E/shot]
Alternate Fire: Cluster grenade barrage [10 E/shot x4]
Hover jets: Press jump while in midair to engage hover jets. Boosters will disengage after a few seconds and be unavailable until
you land. Press jump again while hovering to disengage early.



[S-07] Elite Sigma Mech Tech

Recommended Tier: 10
Crafting: 2500 pixels, 50 Impervium bars at Robotic Crafting Table

With the breakout success of the original Sigma exosuit, demand rose for a higher tier equivalent from special interest groups operating
in extremely hostile environments. After a surprisingly short development period, XS revealed the S-07 Elite Sigma Dedicated Combat Mech.
With every imaginable luxury (that could fit into such a small package), the Elite Sigma quickly became the choice exosuit for the
extremely wealthy mech purveyor. The Elite model features extended hover time, plasma miniguns, and a high explosive variant of
the cluster grenades customers have come to know and love. Warning: Mech can drain energy quickly.

CONTROLS
F: Activate/deactivate tech [30 E/second upkeep]
Primary Fire: Dual plasma miniguns [2.5 E/shot]
Alternate Fire: HE Cluster grenade barrage [40 E/shot x4]
Hover jets: Press jump while in midair to engage hover jets. Boosters will disengage after a few seconds and be unavailable until
you land. Press jump again while hovering to disengage early.



[R-11] Ronin Rho Mech Tech

Recommended Tier: 8-10
Crafting: 3800 pixels, 20 Ferozium bars, and 70 Violium bars at Robotic Crafting Table

Based on a heavily modified Rho chassis, the Ronin represents an unusual combination of mech technology. With its Perdition heat beam
it is able to carve through terrain (and enemies) with ease. For supporting fire it sports a pair of riot grenade launchers on its main
chassis. The Ronin is also able to navigate difficult terrain easily thanks to its advanced hoverjet suite.

CONTROLS
F: Activate/deactivate tech [20 E/second upkeep]
Primary Fire: Perdition Heat Beam [85 E/pulse]
Alternate Fire: Riot grenades [20 E/shot]
Sprint: Hold shift to sprint. Mech can only sprint forwards. [15 E/second upkeep]
Hoverjets: Press jump while in midair to activate. Navigate with movement keys. Press jump again or land to deactivate.
Dodge: Double tap left or right while on the ground for a quick dodge step.



[R-03] Rho Mech Tech

Recommended Tier: 7-10
Crafting: 4200 pixels, 20 Ferozium bars, and 70 Cerulium bars at Robotic Crafting Table

The Rho is a departure from the typically midline XS mech products, eschewing low cost materials and long term durability for ultra-high
tech components and sleek lines. Where the Sigma models excel in versatility and endurance, the Rho was designed for short bursts of
incredible speed and power. The Rho sports a unique combination of equipment: a powerful jetpack, a deadly Plasma Lathe, and the "Zappo"
Graviton Beam capable of pulling enemy targets in from a short distance. Like any high-performance vehicle, the Rho can burn through
energy alarmingly quickly; be wary of being caught in a hostile situation without energy.

CONTROLS
F: Activate/deactivate tech [10 E/second upkeep]
Primary Fire: Arm-mounted Plasma Lathe, damage scales with how much energy you have [35 E/use, very ineffective at low E]
Alternate Fire: "Zappo" Graviton Beam, Pulls enemies in from a short distance [70 E/second while pulling]
Sprint: Hold shift to sprint. Mech can only sprint forwards. [10 E/second upkeep]
Jetpack: Press and hold jump while in midair to engage jetpack. Let go of jump to disable. [35 E/ignition, 100 E/s upkeep]
Jetpack Dash: Quickly doubletap left or right. Only works in the direction mech is facing. [70 E/use]
Backstep: Quickly doubletap left or right. Only works in opposite direction as mech is facing. Only possible while on the ground. [20 E/use]



[R-03C] Pirated Rho Mech Tech

Recommended Tier: 10
Crafting: 1000 pixels, 30 Impervium bars, 15 Rubium bars, and Rho Mech Tech at Robotic Crafting Table

Custom Mech of the dreaded space pirate Captain Q. Flint, who had a penchant for the dramatic. Flint and his crew terrorized the Beta Magnus
Sector for over 30 years before disappearing into deep space and myth. Flint's personal mech has impervium armor plating and a powerful
heavy machine gun nicknamed "Sally". Furthermore, the standard Rho graviton beam has been overcharged and modified to
have the ability to control the target's position, instead of simply pulling the target. These modifications have come at a cost, however,
and the Pirated Rho is not quite as mobile as the standard edition.

One can imagine the fear inspired by the sight of Flint's fearsome mech on helpless villagers and townspeople.

CONTROLS
F: Activate/deactivate tech [10 E/second upkeep]
Primary Fire: Arm-mounted heavy machine gun, more accurate while crouching and less accurate while in midair
Alternate Fire: Graviton Hook, Allows telekinesis of enemies at a short distance [120 E/second while locked on]
Sprint: Hold shift to sprint. Mech can only sprint forwards. [10 E/second upkeep]
Jetpack: Press and hold jump while in midair to engage jetpack. Let go of jump to disable. [35 E/ignition, 100 E/s upkeep]
Jetpack Dash: Quickly doubletap left or right. Only works in the direction mech is facing. [70 E/use]
Backstep: Quickly doubletap left or right. Only works in opposite direction as mech is facing. Only possible while on the ground. [20 E/use]



[T-17] Theta Mech Tech

Recommended Tier: 10
Crafting: 4200 pixels, 100 Rubium bars, 50 Impervium bars at Robotic Crafting Table

The Theta Mech fills the role of heavy weapons platform. It is unlikely that any space traveler outside the field of prolonged and
total galactic war will require use of such a machine, but high-end mercenary corporations have been known to occasionally field
one or two. The T-17 Theta comes equipped with the incredibly powerful Helios Rail Cannon. Its main weapon is supplemented with 
two incendiary grenade racks for close quarters combat. Mobility is limited as is to be expected of such a vehicle, but the T-17
has an integrated jumpjet system that allows it to make short hops when necessary.

CONTROLS:
F: Activate/deactivate tech [30 E/second upkeep]
Primary Fire: Helios Rail Cannon [100 E/shot]
Alternate Fire: Incendiary Grenade Racks [10 E/shot x4]
Jumpjets: Hold jump to charge jumpjets. Release jump to engage. Depending on charge level, jets will propel mech upwards and forwards. [17-24 E/boost]
Emergency Jumpjets: Will automatically activate to slow descent if mech is descending too quickly.

	NOTES
--------------------------------------

Energy usage is as follows: Mechs have a constant energy drain depending on the power and class of the mech; but their main source
of energy consumption is from using weapons/mech features.

Keep in mind this is a mod for a game in beta. All balancing is subject to change--I am waiting for Starbound to get closer to
final release before finalizing balance. Starbound beta patches are likely to break elements of this mod; I will try to keep the mod
working for the latest patch and for final release.
